* Here are the steps to install and configure the necessary components to run a Prysm validator node on Google Cloud following common best practices:

1) Create a new VM instance with a static internal IP and no external IP access. This improves security. Allocate at least 8 vCPUs and 30GB RAM.

2) Generate a password-protected SSH key pair and use the public key to login instead of a password for security. 

3) Hardened the operating system by disabling password authentication, removing unnecessary packages and services, enabling firewall.

4) Install Docker and Docker Compose. Configure Docker to only allow connections from the local host for extra security. 

5) Download and extract the latest Prysm release. This contains all the required binaries and configurations. 

6) Create directories for persistent validator data and wallet files that will survive container restarts. 

7) Configure Prysm's `config.yaml` file with your validator keys, passwords, beacon node endpoints etc. 

8) Use Docker Compose to launch the Prysm services in containers with the `--network host` flag to avoid port mapping issues. 

9) Monitor logs to ensure services start successfully and the beacon node syncs fully before depositing validator funds.

10) Regularly update Prysm to latest versions for security fixes and new features. Back up wallet files and validator keys.
