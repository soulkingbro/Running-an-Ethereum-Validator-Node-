* Here are the steps to acquire 32 ETH for staking and depositing into the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract:

1. Generate a new wallet to hold your validator keys and funds. The easiest way is to use the Prysm CLI tool - `prysmcli keys add validator`

2. Back up both the public and secret key that are printed. Store them securely offline in multiple locations in case of data loss. 

3. Obtain 32 ETH for staking. The best options are using testnets like Goerli or buying on a cryptocurrency exchange. 

4. Transfer the 32 ETH from your wallet to the deposit contract address on the desired network (Goerli, Ropsten etc). You can find the contract address in the Prysm documentation.

5. Deposit the ETH using the `prysmcli` tool. Run `prysmcli validator deposit --amount 32 --contract-address 0x1234...` 

6. Wait for 1-3 epochs (6-12 hours typically) for the deposit to be included before your validator can be activated. 

7. Verify the deposit transaction and amount on a block explorer to ensure success.

8. Secure your validator keys at all times as losing them means permanently locking up your 32 ETH deposit.
