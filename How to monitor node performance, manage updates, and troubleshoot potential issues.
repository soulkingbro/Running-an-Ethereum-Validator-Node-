* Here are steps to monitor node performance, manage updates, and troubleshoot potential issues:

1) Monitoring

- Check Prysm dashboard at http://localhost:8080 for sync status, proposals/attestations, rewards etc
- View logs with `docker logs -f prysm_beacon_chain` to monitor sync, proposals etc  
- Monitor resources with `docker stats` and system monitoring tools

2) Managing Updates

- Check https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases for latest versions
- Before updating, backup keys, configs and blockchain data
- Update Prysm docker image with `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`
- Update Prysm binaries if a major release 

3) Troubleshooting

- If not syncing, check logs/firewalls and ensure outbound ports are open
- If proposals/attestations are low, check configs and keys are valid  
- Monitor system resources for any bottlenecks
- Rebuild/restart services if issues persist
- As a last resort, reset blockchain data and resync from scratch

- Common issues include port conflicts, low disk space, outdated software
- Google forums and Prysm Discord are helpful for specific issues
